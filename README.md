# FriendFinder

## Overview

This project is an application that finds the closest friend to a user.  The user answers a few simple survey questions, and then the applicaiton matches the user to the closest match in the database.  The project is deployed on Heroku and can be found here: https://fierce-caverns-76933.herokuapp.com/. 

## Technical Approach
I used express routing and ajax get and post requests to route pages to create an API from which I can get pages.
